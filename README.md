# CHAOS_Automotive_HeadlightUnit
This repository contains an example of an Automotive application (Headlight Unit) developed using CHAOS.

# Introduction
The Headlinght Unit is a quite common example of an Automotive ECU and in uite often used to demonstrate the usage of SW development tools connected with the Automotive Industry (tipically AUTOSAR).
In this specific example we'll use CHAOS and some simple embedded SW best practive to develop a sample architecture and an implementation of an Automotive Front Light (HeadLight) Control Unit, and run it on a real evaluation board (based on PIC32MZ EF Microcontroller, Automotive qualified ans suitable for ECU development).

# Requirements
The first thing we need are some high level requirement (often called Vehicle Function) for our HeadLight Unit.


# SW Architecture
